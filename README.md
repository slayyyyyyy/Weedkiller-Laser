# Weedkiller Laser - an 8x8 matrix game 

As a gardener, your job is to make sure people's yards are being taken care of. That includes making sure that the weeds growing are kept at bay, which is a trifle for your skillful hands. But when a rival gardening corporation appears in town, you start to worry about going out of business. That's when an alien spaceship drops one of their weapons in your courtyard one night, a laser gun inscriptioned Lasergun3000. After firing it accidentally, you notice something: the clump of weeds that was your target is completely gone, leaving the grass patch cleaner than a lawn mower could ever. With this new tool, you could make sure your small business doesn't go bankrupt. 

Destroy the weeds in people's yards with the laser in the shortest amount of time to secure your company's future in Weedkiller Laser!
